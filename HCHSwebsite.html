  <h2>Working Papers</h2>

  <p><i>In NYS, anyone ages 14 to 17 (minors), including college students, high school graduates, married students, and volunteer workers, must obtain an employment certificate before they may begin work. Many people call this “working papers."<br><br>To obtain an employment certificate, students must fill out an Application for Employment Certificate (see below), evidence of age (Birth Certificate, etc.) and present documentation of a physical exam from a school or private physician, physician’s assistant or nurse practitioner licensed to practice within New York State. Said examination must have been given within 12 months prior to issuance of the employment certificate.<br><br>Next, students must submit it to the designated person in the high school or middle school that they attend. NYS schools can also provide information on employment certification and provide working papers when a school does not (e.g., schools are closed, out-of-state students).<br><br>The school will then issue an employment certificate to the student.</i></p>
